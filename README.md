# HK Housing Analysis

## What is this
Displaying data to show the housing statistics in one of the world's most expensive housing markets.

## About
I found that the HK housing problem is very evident and the income gap is always enormous. I realized the World Bank has an API so I decided to try making a webpage in NodeJS.
