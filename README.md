## Note

This Jupyter Notebook should not be considered advice of any kind and you should do your own research or consult a qualified person before considering buying into anything.

Data is provided by official Government of Hong Kong departments and offices and are not guaranteed to be accurate and should only be used as reference. The data for this project is static and will not be updated in the future.

Update: Turns out the large difference was because I accidentally looked at prices in square foot instead of square meters. Since square meter is much larger than square foot, the price is much higher, making the average prices correct if converting from square meter to square foot.
