## Note

This Jupyter Notebook should not be considered advice of any kind and you should do your own research or consult a qualified person before considering buying into anything.

Data is provided by official Government of Hong Kong departments and offices and are not guaranteed to be accurate and should only be used as reference. The data for this project is static and will not be updated in the future.

Currently, there is a large difference between the average price per square foot on the RVD data versus the current HK housing market, so if you are actually looking for housing, you should probably visit an actual
broker or real estate firm for up-to-date market prices.
